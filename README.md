## Parts
The UV eraser is so I am able to clear the memory of the rom as it is an eprom and not an eeprom or flash memory

I have a very limited idea of how to build a cpu apart from being a first year student studying computer architecture.
The aim of the project is that I want this cpu to work, it doesn't have to be fast, it doesn't have to be applicable in real world applications, it just has to work as a cpu.

For this project I am going to use a 16 bit rom and 8 bit ram so then I can call to the ACC
